AutoC4 Logicer et al
====================

Some python scripts implementing MQTT clients to control the AutoC4
infrastructure and the logic for that.

Components
----------

* Logicer: Central control logic
* MPD - MQTT transport for simple commands
* IRC Topicer: Set the c4 irc topic (Door open/closed)
* MQTT test client/environment

Disclaimer

This is, although a production system, not the best code quality. Pull requests
welcome.
